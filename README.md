# network-analyzer-frontend

This is a fullstack application using D3 for data visualization. We chose to use a node chart because the physics applied to it make it unique for identifying how users (orange nodes) are related to one another through similarities (green nodes) In this application we had users input or select passions, hobbies, and interests and these are represented with dotted solid and colored lines. The intention for this application is to use it in order for new people to be paired or grouped together in a work or school setting.
